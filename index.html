      <h3>How It Started...</h3>

         <div class="float-child"> <h4 id="chris">Chris</h4><img id="youngBC" src="images/us02.jpg" alt="A young Brandy hugs an equally young Chris.">
            <img id="oldBC" src="images/us01.jpg" alt="A red-bearded Chris and a blonde Brandy make kissy faces at the camera."></div>
         <div id="us">
            <p>Picture this: a small town, a pizza joint, and an unlikely romance. 
            We both toiled away at Pizza Hut, and while I was the epitome of a perfect daughter, 
            Chris appeared as a pot-smoking skateboarder with a flowing blonde ponytail that rivaled mine. 
            Talk about an unconventional match! On one hand, I was the epitome of innocence, while he 
            jammed out to Sepultura, rocking to the beat of a different drum. It seemed like a recipe 
            for disaster, and little did I know, a ginger-colored beard was lurking in his future, 
            poised to lead us down a path I never anticipated. Yet, despite the odds, I took a chance 
            on this wild-haired rebel. And boy, am I glad I did! Behind his unruly appearance, he had 
            hidden depths. He strummed the guitar with the skill of a maestro, worshipped heavy metal 
            like a true devotee, and possessed a nerdiness that transcended time and space. He was, 
            without a doubt, the smartest person I knew, albeit the most stubborn. But let me tell you, 
            his stubbornness was only matched by his ability to make me laugh until my sides hurt. So, 
            dear reader, hold on tight, for this red-headed adventure is just getting started!

      <h3>How It's Going...</h3>
      <h4>Perrin</h4>
      <p><img id="perrin" src="images/Perrin01.jpg" alt="Perrin dressed in a vest and tie for Prom.">Ah, Perrin, the epitome of a charming ginger extraordinare! Named after 
         a character from the "Wheel of Time" series, paying homage to his father's unwavering nerdiness. 
         From the moment he graced the world with his fiery red hair, it was evident that he was destined 
         for something special. While Perrin may have exhibited a tad bit of whininess as a child, with a 
         meticulous obsession over open cabinet doors, his true nature shone through as incredibly sweet 
         and caring. He still leans towards introversion and shyness, finding it a struggle to ask a 
         waitress for extra ketchup or a box for his food. However, despite his reserved nature, he is 
         undoubtedly one of the most likable individuals one could ever encounter. Even from a young age, 
         random people and kids would joyfully shout, "Hi, Perrin!" because his affable demeanor simply 
         radiated charisma. Now, at the age of seventeen, Perrin has blossomed into an undeniably handsome 
         young man, and perhaps, just a smidge egotistical about itâ€”haha, who can blame him for reveling 
         in the perks of his good looks? Alongside his undeniable charm, Perrin carries forward his dad's 
         nerdy legacy of a profound obsession with all things Star Wars and Lego. It seems impossible for 
         him to have a conversation without diving headfirst into discussions about lightsabers or a 
         brick-by-brick analysis of the latest Lego set. Star Wars and Lego have become an integral part of Perrin's essence, 
         flowing through his veins like a potent ginger elixir. He consumes, dreams, and breathes these 
         beloved franchises with unwavering passion. Beyond his devotion to galactic battles and intricate 
         constructions, Perrin exhibits a remarkable sense of responsibility and an unyielding work ethic. 
         His sweetness and lovable nature warm the hearts of all who have the pleasure of knowing him, while 
         his wit and cleverness leave them thoroughly entertained. Who knows what surprises await us in the 
         saga of Perrin, the ginger Jedi with a heart of gold?

         <h4>Willow</h4>
         <p><img id="willow" src="images/willow01.jpg" alt="Willow holding chopsticks, ready to eat her sushi.">Then there was Willow, the fiery-haired force to be reckoned with! 
            Named after the legendary character from the fantasy film "Willow," it's clear that my 
            husband's nerdy hold on me knows no bounds. Willow's red hair, or lack thereof during 
            her bald years, may have left us guessing, but her personality leaves no room for 
            uncertainty. Independent and introspective, she possesses a fire within that matches 
            the vibrancy of her hair. And let me tell you, this girl is not afraid to let you know 
            if you're not showering her with the love and attention she deserves. It's like a tiny 
            diva wrapped in a ginger package. Now, at the age of fifteen, Willow has channeled her 
            nerdom into a different realm: the magical land of theater. Don't even try to avoid hearing 
            about her latest Broadway obsession; she's a one-girl theater troupe ready to enlighten you 
            with all the showbiz knowledge she can muster. She's the living embodiment of progressive 
            ideals, donning her rainbow flag proudly and blazing a trail as a proud Gen Z advocate. 
            And honestly, I'm here for it. Willow is a joy to talk to, laugh with, and be around. 
            She's got spunk, an artistic streak, a knack for all things trendy, and a sharp mind 
            that leaves you in awe. Insanely likable and unapologetically herself, she embodies the 
            spirit of a spunky redhead navigating her way through life. As we venture into the realm 
            of driving with this spirited soul, we're embarking on a crash course in raising a fearless, 
            fiery redhead. Wish us luck as we navigate the twists and turns of Willow's remarkable journey!

         <h4>Loial</h4>
         <p><img id="loial" src="images/Loial01.jpg" alt="Loial flexes his muscles and shows off his new mohawk."> And then there was Loial, our ginger gem of comedic brilliance! 
            Solidifying his father's nerdy legacy, he too draws inspiration from the pages of the "Wheel 
            of Time" series for his name. From the moment he could string words together, Loial showcased 
            a natural talent for comedy. Insanely clever comebacks and quips rolled off his tongue 
            effortlessly, leaving us in fits of laughter. This kid has an outgoing and talkative nature 
            that could rival a radio host on caffeine, with a temper that once rivaled the Hulk himself. 
            Yes, there was a time when he resorted to biting those who dared to disagree with him. 
            Luckily, he outgrew that phase (or so we hope), but his sense of humor and social charm have 
            only grown stronger. Now at the ripe age of thirteen, this quirky, freckle-faced, ginger dynamo 
            has truly come into his own. Loial is a master of video games, a Dungeon Master extraordinaire 
            in the realm of D&D, a comedic genius who leaves us in stitches, a talented singer and drummer, 
            and soon-to-be a high school theater enthusiast. He's even embracing the wonders of puberty 
            with a mix of excitement and anticipation. With hopes of growing taller, sprouting some chest 
            hair, and acquiring "free muscles," he's ready to claim his dominance over his older siblings, 
            who once felt his mighty bites. As his voice wobbles in unpredictable ways, the jury is still 
            out on whether he'll surpass his siblings in height. But regardless, I'll continue to snuggle 
            up with my lovable boy, reveling in his quirky randomness, which, despite his ginger locks, 
            brings me immeasurable joy. Oh, the adventures and laughter that lie ahead with Loial, the 
            ginger king of comedy and unexpected surprises!</p>
